Here is our official communication rules:

🔒 Our New Rule Set (so nothing good gets lost)
Rule 1: One Change = One Action
We only change one clearly named thing at a time. No bundles. No “while you’re in there.”
Example:
“Change: Move J&V’s down slightly.”
That’s it. Nothing else moves.
Rule 2: We Declare “Locked” Elements
Anything you like stays frozen unless you explicitly unlock it.
You say:
“LOCK: Blue Universe position & animation”
I will treat that as hands off.
Rule 3: Before Coding, I Repeat Back
Before I touch code, I’ll respond with:
✔️ What stays exactly the same
🔧 What will change (one item)
🚫 What I will NOT touch
Only after you say “Proceed” do I send code.
This prevents accidental upgrades turning into regressions.
Rule 4: Visual Direction, Not Vibes
Instead of “a little / more / less,” we use directional intent:
“Down by a noticeable amount”
“Visually centered behind”
“Spawn only from edges”
“Rare = once every ~30–60 seconds”
That gives me precision without guesswork.
Rule 5: Version Mindset
Every step is an upgrade branch, not a replacement.
If something feels worse, we don’t panic—we say:
“Revert X to previous behavior”
No ego. No loss. Just evolution.
Rule 6: FULL CODE — ALWAYS
🔥 No partials. Ever.
Every time I send code:
Full HTML
Full CSS
Full JS (if used)
Even if only one line changed — you still get everything.
